<h1>Restaurant Order Analysis</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills by exploring, querying, and analyzing a mock restaurant database. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from menu and order data to better understand customer behavior, item popularity, and sales performance. The project is ideal for showcasing basic SQL querying, data aggregation, and relational database joins

<h2>Languages and Libraries Used</h2>

- SQL (MySQL syntax)
- Restaurant Orders Dataset

<h2>Database Structure</h2>

Two tables were created and populated:

- <b>menu_items</b>: Contains menu item information such as name, category, and price
- <b>order_details</b>: Records order transactions including timestamps and item IDs

<h2>Project Files</h2>

- <b>create_restaurant_db.sql</b>: Creates the database schema and populates tables with sample data
- <b>exploring_items_table.sql</b>: Analyzes the menu: item count, pricing, and category-based insights
- <b>exploring_orders_table.sql</b>: Examines order trends: date ranges, high-volume orders, and item counts
- <b>analyze_customer_behavior.sql</b>: Combines order and menu data to identify top-spending orders and most/least popular items

<h2>Key Analysis Highlights</h2>

<b>Menu Insights</b>

- Total number of menu items and categories
- Least and most expensive items overall and per category
- Average price by category

<b>Order Behavior</b>

- Date range and volume of transactions
- Orders with unusually high item counts
- Total number of items per order

<b>Customer Purchase Trends</b>

- Most and least frequently ordered items
- Top 5 orders by total spend
- Breakdown of top orders by item category

<h2>Skills Demonstrated</h2>

- Relational joins and aggregate functions
- Data cleaning and exploratory analysis using SQL
- Query optimization and readability
- Business insight extraction using raw transactional data

<h2>How to Run</h2>

- Load the create_restaurant_db.sql script into your MySQL server
- Execute individual analysis scripts in order or selectively for targeted insights
- Use any SQL interface to run and interpret results
